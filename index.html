                    <p>I am Keila, a fourth-year computer science major :)
                        <em>I have a deep love and passion for the art of programming!</em>
                        During my freetime (and when school permits) I enjoy spending time with my friends, playing the guitar, listening to music, reading,
                        meeting new people, traveling, and hanging out with my family.
